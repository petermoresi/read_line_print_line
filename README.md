# read_line_print_line

A collection of simple programs that read stdin and pass through to stdout.

The project includes samples for many different languages.

These can be used as a starter project for anyone that wants to write a command line program that process data with pipes.

Example:

```sh
cat myfile.txt | read_line_print_line > result.txt
```
